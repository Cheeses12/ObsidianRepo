## **Abstract**

Which is the fundamental contradiction of capitalism: the capital-labour polarity or the contrast between socialised production and private appropriation? Those looking on the capital-labour polarity as the main contradiction will argue that socialism arises when the passage from a system controlled by capital owners to a system of worker-run firms sparks off the reversal of the usual capital-labour relation. Conversely, those who think that the key contradiction of capitalism is the contrast between socialised production and private appropriation will contend that the social order to rise from the ashes of capitalism is a centrally planned system.

This paper reports arguments in support of the former option.

## **1. Introduction** 

In economics, the term ‘revolution’ (in the way a society is organised) designates a change in the production mode. This was certainly the view of Marx, the great theoretician of modes of production and the way they arise, grow and die (in this connection, see McQuarie and Amburgey 1978); and it is also the opinion of anyone prepared to admit that different production modes are possible and that socialism is an alternative to the capitalistic production mode.[[1]](#_ftn1) Ever since the earliest formulation of the market socialism theory (following the so-called 'debate of the 'thirties'), the claim that socialism is a possible new social organisation mode has never been called into question either by those who look upon it as an advancement or those who rate it as an evil.

In Marx’s approach, man is a social animal and his production activities are communal in nature. The laws governing such activities are summed up in an excerpt from the Preface to _A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy_ which is frequently quoted by Marxist theorists, including Gramsci.  

“In the real production of their existence men inevitably enter into definite relations, which are independent of their will, namely relations of production appropriate to a given stage in the development of their material forces of production. The totality of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society, the real foundation on which arises a legal and political superstructure, and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness. At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society come into conflict with the existing relations of production or – this merely expresses the same thing in legal terms – with the property relations within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution” (Marx 1859, p. 5).[[2]](#_ftn2)

With specific regard to the definition of the mode of production as a whole of productive forces and production relations, Althusser argued that this Marxian notion had opened up the ‘continent of History’ to scientific knowledge and had created the assumptions for a single theory subsuming within itself all human sciences, from sociology to psychology and any other science concerned with investigating society and humankind (Althusser 1969 and 1995, p. 23; Luporini 1954 and Vygodskij 1967, pp. 4-5).[[3]](#_ftn3) 

Productive forces are the material foundation of any production mode, but as they can only act themselves out within the corresponding relations of production, it is the relations between the productive forces existing from time to time that play a decisive role (Althusser 1969 and 1995, p. 26; see, also, p. 28). According to Althusser, most Marxists had given insufficient attention to this point.

As Marx and Engels defined socialism as the transitional society immediately before communism, nothing should prevent a Marxist from categorising a system of democratically managed worker-owned firms operating in a market economy as a genuine form of socialism. One of the first theorists to draw attention to Marx's views on self-management has commented: “Anyone equating socialism with a system where the production and interchange apparatuses are managed by workers moves in unison with Marx’s approach” (see Brachet 1975, p. 303; see, also, Damjanovic 1962; Bourdet 1974, pp. 49 ff; Pelikan 1977, pp. 143 ff; Lawler 1998, Ollman 1998b, pp. 113-18, and others); and our approach in this paper should dispel any doubts concerning this point. 

The awareness that revolution is a dominant of Marx’s approach leads us to endorse Lukàcs's claim that a) the test that Marxism is required to pass is the belief that socialism is a practicable system (see, for example, Panaccione 1974, p. 4, Bordiga 1976, p. 99, and Séve 2004, pp. 106-07) and b) only those thinking of the establishment of a (strictly Marxian) socialist system as a feasible project can qualify as Marxists.[[4]](#_ftn4)

However, revolution can be carried through in two different ways, both of which entail nationalising means of production: a) by substituting the plan for the working of markets, or b) by substituting labour for capital in the management of firms.

In the light of the foregoing, in this paper I will try to demonstrate**:** a) that the prerequisite for the implementation of one or the other type of revolution is an escalating conflict between productive forces and production relations; and b) that the key contradiction of capitalism (which Marxists hold to vouchsafe the advent of socialism at some point in time**)** is the clash between labour power and capitalistic relations, between a productive force connoted by rapidly increasing entrepreneurial skills and production relations which continue to be shaped by the power of capitalists to make all the decisions concerning production. And from these conclusions it clearly follows that the main – if not only – way to attain socialism is reversing the current capital-labour relation and establishing a system in keeping with the principles of market socialism.

As far as the alternative type of revolution is concerned, it has been proved wrong by history and would hardly be compatible with a system of self-managed firms. As a result, it is unlikely to be re-enacted in future.

Whereas most Marxists are sure to rate my conclusions as heterodox, I reckon that they perfectly suit the aim of this paper, which is not to analyse Marx's actual theoretical approach, but to suggest a possible modern-day interpretation of Marxism.

## **2. The Labour Managed Firm**

In Vanek’s theoretical approach (1971a and 1971b), the ‘pure’ self-managed firm (LMF) is defined as a labour managed firm which funds its investments solely with loan capital and segregates capital incomes from incomes from work. In point of fact, this type of cooperative may opt for self-financing if the members pass majority resolutions to this effect, but in this case, (given the need to keep earned incomes apart from capital incomes) the members must be entitled to receive bonds in the value of the earnings that would otherwise have been distributed to them**.**

Consequently, an LMF falling within Vanek’s definition is a ‘pure labour’ firm in which labour is internal and capital is strictly external. One major consequence derives from this. Whereas economic theorists have traditionally identified three factors of production, capital, labour and land, at this stage in history, in consequence of the lesser role of farming at a mature capitalistic stage practical economists preferably concern themselves with capital and labour. Hence, it seems possible to argue that capitalism arises when owners of capital (or their representatives) hire labour power, pay workers a fixed income (wages), make all the decisions within the enterprise in line with the ‘one share, one vote’ principle and appropriate the relevant profits. Conversely, if workers (or their representatives) borrow capital, pay capitalists a fixed income (interest), make every decision in line with the ‘one head, one vote’ principle and appropriate the residual, the system of worker-run firms that arises can be said to give rise to a socialist order (see Jossa 2011).[[5]](#_ftn5)

In other words, from Vanek’s definition of the LMF cooperative it follows that the introduction of a system of ‘pure’ labour-managed firms would literally reverse the capitalistic capital-labour relation, and in our opinion the revolution triggered by this reversal can be defined as genuinely socialist: by definition, socialism is the social order which will emerge from the ashes of capitalism in consequence of the working of the laws governing this system and, as we shall argument, it is possible to argue that the very laws of the evolution of capitalism and of its main contradiction, will in due time give rise to a social organisation where capital is stripped of the power to dictate what shall be right and decisions are made by labour.

The claim that a reversed capital-labour relation gives rise to a socialist system receives confirmation from the demonstration that the Vanek-type LMF is to be classified as a public firm. And this is why I shall briefly discuss the ownership issue.

The business of an LMF is entirely financed with loan capital and its members are not required to invest resources of their own either on joining the firm or at a later stage. As a result, this firm cannot be the property of capitalists. Neither can it be assigned to workers, since exiting members forfeit title in it. If workers were assumed to be the owners of their firm, exiting members would be entitled to a share of its capital goods, and this would jeopardise both the firm’s viability and the rights of its creditors.

In fact, nothing stands in the way of vesting in the firm the status of a separate legal entity and the associated title to its production means, but such a solution would provide no indication as to who would take over its capital goods or have to honour its debts if the firm were to become insolvent. 

The necessary conclusion of these reflections is that the ownership title of a firm which can neither be assigned to workers nor to capitalists must either be vested in the State or an outside agency (see Vanek 1970, Jossa-Cuomo 1997, pp. 257-71 and Jossa 1998, pp. 91-94).

However, as all management powers are in the hands of workers (see below), it is worth stating right from the start that the public ownership of self-managed firms is merely figurative and has hardly any material implications. 

From the foregoing, it follows that the ‘purest’ possible system of democratic or socialist firms is one where firms are run by workers, where production means are the property of the State and where, quite interestingly, the public nature of the LMF is not the result of a ‘political’ or ‘ideological’ choice, but a direct implication of its true nature.

The ownership issue is extensively covered in a considerable body of literature dealing with the collapse of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a subject on which we cannot expatiate in this paper (see, for instance, Pejovich 1966, chap. I, and 1997; Horvat 1976, chap. 4 and 2000; Ellerman 1992). 

In conclusion, as socialist systems are typified by publicly-owned production means by definition, our analysis of the ownership issue supports the claim that the introduction of labour management gives rise to socialism.[[6]](#_ftn6) 

## **3. The Key Contradiction of Capitalistic Systems.**

Besides discussing the active function of thought as the faculty allowing man not only to contemplate nature and society, but to act upon them and work towards change, in _Theses on Feuerbach_ Marx made it clear that the precondition for changing and advancing society was solving its inherent contradictions. This may explain why we deem it important to identify the most glaring contradiction of capitalism from a Marxist perspective.

The first idea to cross the minds of Marxists and non-Marxists alike is the capital-labour polarity. Quoting Godelier, for instance, “the first contradiction we come up against in capitalism is the conflict between capital and labour, between capitalists as a class and workers as a class. The former own capital; the latter are bereft of it. The profits of the former amount to the value of the work for which the latter have not been remunerated” (1966, p. 29). 

As Gramsci puts it (1921, pp. 148-49), “the control issue boils down to the question of industrial power, the question of deciding whether industrial production plans are to be framed in the interests of bankers and stockjobbers or, in contrast, in the interests of the masses; by the trustees of capitalists or those of the working class.” The workers’ state (i.e. a state where workers are in control of both businesses and government) is specific to the transitional stage from capitalism to communism, he added, and “the workers’ state is not an arbitrary choice, nor is it a vain hope. It is a historical necessity which grows out of the very circumstances created by class conflict. When, in response to the errors or ineptitude of the bourgeoisie, individual categories of working people gain a sense of their joint interests, then communists claim that the social assumptions for the rise of a workers’ state are given” (_ibid._, p. 149). 

The idea that class struggle is the key problem of capitalistic economies is doubtless one of Marx's major contributions to the understanding of the social order in which we live. And as this idea was first stated in early writings not yet supported by a sound grounding in political economy, there are reasons for assuming that Marx did not take it over from any of the writers on whom he drew for his later studies. It features in such an early work as the _Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right_, which Marx wrote in the autumn of 1843 and issued in the early months of 1844, and it continued to occupy centre stage in his later theoretical approach. 

Accordingly, there are reasons for arguing that the true precondition for superseding capitalism is solving the dialectical contradiction arising from the conflict between a class which wields all power and a class expected to obey passively, not the planning-markets opposition.[[7]](#_ftn7) To look upon the plan-market option as the key problem – Bettelheim wrote – is a severe mistake which diverts attention towards side issues and, hence, away from the real crux of the issue: the existence of a class – the ‘bourgeoisie’ – whose primary aim is to prevent workers from attaining power. This is why an occasional acceleration or stalemate in market relations at one stage or other is, in itself, not enough to make us assume that the world is progressing towards socialism or moving away from it (see Bettelheim 1969 and, among others, Poulantzas 1974 and Marek 1982, p. 751). 

In contrast, Engels and orthodox Marxists did not think of the capital-labour opposition as the basic contradiction in capitalism. In orthodox Marxist terms, the basic contradiction originates from a mismatch between the socialised character of production in large-size industrial concerns (where hundreds and even thousands of workers see to their jobs side by side) and the private character of appropriation (the very underpinning of privately owned production means) (see, for example, Engels 1978, part 3, II and Tsuru 1969, pp. 364-65). And according to Engels (and other Marxists), this contradiction sparks off an additional one:

“the contradiction between socialised production and capitalistic appropriation now presents itself as an antagonism between the organization of production in the individual workshop and the anarchy of production in the society as a whole”, Engels wrote (1878, pp. 260-61).[[8]](#_ftn8)

Time and again Engels argued that these contradictions were actually nothing but different ways of describing one and the same state of affairs. In _Anti-Dühring_, he wrote (1878a, pp. 260-61):

“The contradiction between socialised production and capitalistic appropriation now presents itself as an antagonism between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.” 

Commenting on this passage, Sève (1970, p. 145) quite appropriately objected that each of these contradictions obeys a different logic and that, consequently, Engels could not be assumed to have described them as identical in purely abstract terms.

But why is it important to distinguish between these two main contradictions of capitalism?

Lack of agreement on the basic contradiction of capitalism has a major bearing on the possibility to predict the kind of social order that will rise from the ruins of capitalism. Those looking on the capital-labour polarity as the main contradiction will argue that socialism – the social order of the transitional stage between capitalism and communism – arises when the capital-labour relation is reversed as a result of the replacement of a system controlled by capital owners with a system of worker-run firms. Conversely, those who think that the key contradiction of capitalism is the contrast between socialised production and private appropriation will contend that the social order to rise from the ashes of capitalism is a centrally planned system.[[9]](#_ftn9) 

The question, then, is: are these two contradictions really antithetical?

Before we try to answer this question, it is worth examining a ‘querelle’ between Godelier and Sève which may shed further light on the subject of this paper.  

## **4. A ‘quarrell’ between Godelier and Sève**

Describing Marx’s analysis of the contradictions of capitalism as a rigorous scientific approach founded on a sound distinction between economic science and ideology, the structuralist Maurice Godelier claimed that the main contradiction is not the capital-labour opposition. This contradiction – he argued – is internal to capitalistic production relations and specific to capitalism and, due to its specificity, it necessarily connotes the system right from its onset and reproduces itself incessantly, as long as capitalism exists.

In fact, Godelier (1970) argued, the most glaring contradiction within the capitalistic mode of production is a mismatch between the social character of productive forces and the private nature of the means of production. This contradiction, he added, is not internal, but external to the mode of production. It originates from a structural discrepancy between increasingly socialised productive forces and persistently private production relations, arises at a given stage in the evolution of productive forces (specifically upon the rise of industry), and is consequently not coeval with capitalism. Hence, Godelier concluded, Marx dealt with two different types of contradictions. One of these, Godelier claims, is a structural discrepancy which is internal to production relations and is the first to arise; and although it changes during the transition from free competition to monopoly, it persists over the whole course of capitalism. The other, he adds, arises at successive steps in-between the two structural elements of the mode of production, relations of production and productive forces. As a result – and this is the core of Godelier’s argument – the former does not subsume within itself the preconditions for its solution and these preconditions must necessarily lie outside it. This explains Godelier’s claim that the contrast between socialised production and private appropriation is the key contradiction of capitalism.[[10]](#_ftn10)

At this point, I will try to establish if Godelier’s line of reasoning is correct.

According to Séve (1967, p. 66), one point in Godelier’s approach is consistent with Marx’s thought, while the rest of his line of reasoning is objectionable. First of all, he argues, by downscaling the worker-capitalist polarity to a non-crucial contradiction Godelier denies the role of class struggle as the main driving force behind revolutionary change. Marx – he continues – did not think that this crucial contradiction would automatically be superseded as a result of the pressure of the evolution of productive forces; he only emphasised the role that the revolutionary efforts of the working class and its allies – i.e. the dynamics underlying antithetical production relations – were bound to play (see Sève 1967, p. 67). In Marx, he added, the dynamics behind the evolution of productive forces will clash into conflict with production relations from within, rather than from without, because they self-generate the external and internal prerequisites for superseding class antagonism.

An additional point of Godelier’s approach to which Séve takes exception is the idea that the conflict between socialised production and private appropriation does not date back to the very origins of capitalism, i.e. his contention that productive forces were initially pressed into action by the capitalistic production relations and that the opposite applies to a later stage only. If this should hold true, Séve objects, growth rates would have to slow down _pari passu_ with the advancement of capitalism, which they do not. In fact, historical evidence has taught that they are usually slack in early capitalistic phases and tend to accelerate at maturer capitalistic stages. Capitalistic systems, Sève remarks, have always been characterised by contradictory relations between productive forces and production relations and, accordingly, by contradictory growth trends. Engels himself emphasised this point when he spoke of these two contradictions as coeval with capitalism and (as said above) of the socialised production vs private appropriation contradiction as an antagonism between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

From Sève’s perspective, Godelier’s mistake is to have ignored such a crucial Marxian notion as the mode of production. In Marx, the phrase mode of production designates a blend of two elements, production forces and production relations which, far from being ‘two distinct things’ (as argued by Godelier), are closely related to each other. In short, Séve’s main objection is that the crucial contradiction of capitalism is internal to the mode of production, rather than an external opposition between two distinct structures.[[11]](#_ftn11) 

The conclusion I may draw from this debate is that the main point of the matter is which of these two main contradictions – the capital-labour conflict or the plan-market opposition – will reach maturity in due time.

## **5. On the Dynamics of the Plan-Market Contradiction**

As mentioned above, according to orthodox Marxists the revolution sparked off by a mounting conflict between socialised production and private distribution is the adoption of central planning.  

Lenin spelt this out in bold letters. In _The impending catastrophe and how to combat it_, a pamphlet written on the eve of the October revolution (Spring 1917), he clearly stated that the material preconditions for the transition to socialism were created during the state-controlled monopoly capitalism phase, which he termed ‘state capitalism’ and described as the ‘ante-chamber' of socialism or “the rung on the ladder of history between which and the rung called socialism _there are no intermediate rungs_” (see Lenin 1917, p. 341).

Capitalism differs from pre-capitalistic systems – Lenin wrote – because it is characterised by close interconnections between its production branches and, hence, by an increasing interdependence between production activities. At the monopoly capitalism stage, he argued, these interdependencies reach levels at which control over production is taken over by the banking system. As pointed out by Hilferding, in Lenin’s approach the banking system plays a major role in this process and banks are the vital ganglia of modern capitalistic organisation. Thanks to the involvement of banks in trade and industry, Lenin argued, the banking system reaches a concentration level at which it appears as the trunk from which the bulk of business activities branch out and as a basic factor accelerating such interconnections and concentration.

In Lenin’s approach, on the one hand the capitalistic state tends to exacerbate capitalistic exploitation due to these interconnections, the resulting interdependence of production activities and increasing concentration levels, specifically by steering and controlling production in the interests of business magnates and the propertied class; on the other, the banking system paves the way for the advent of socialism, since “a large-scale capitalist economy, by its very technique, is socialised economy” (_ibidem_, p. 322). “If a huge capitalist undertaking becomes a monopoly, it means that it serves the whole nation” (_ibidem_, p. 340), because it works for millions of people and, even more importantly, whether directly or indirectly, it “unites by its operations thousands and tens of thousands families” (_ibidem_, p. 322). In Lenin’s approach, therefore, socialism is “merely state-capitalist monopoly which is made to serve the interests of the whole people and has to that extent ceased to be capitalist monopoly” (_ibidem_, p. 340); as a result, it will be established as soon as the state of capitalists and landowners is replaced with a State intending to abolish all privileges and to introduce the fullest level of democracy. 

In short, in the opinion of Lenin ever closer interconnections between industrial branches and central planning pave the way for the nationalisation of the production apparatus as a whole and set off a head-on clash with private appropriation. And at that stage, Lenin argued, the nationalisation of production means, while triggering the socialisation of production activities, turns distribution into a socialised activity (because decreed by the State) and thereby sweeps away the most glaring contradiction of capitalism. Both production and distribution turn into state-controlled activities.

What should we say of this approach? A close look at the contemporary scene is enough to show that it is no reliable proxy for the situation prevailing at the present day, when the competitive pressure of a globalised economy is obliging businesses to opt for more flexible and cost-effective organisational structures and is thereby generating a proliferation of smaller-size firms. Throughout the world, businesses are joining together to form 'network systems’ founded on a key role of product-, transport- and telecommunications-related links. One of many possible examples is Italy. From the mid-1960s onward, vertically integrated ‘column-fashion’ business groups have been gradually replaced by ‘network system groups' where each firm specialises in one or a few production process steps and links up to the remaining network businesses along an ’assembly line’ of sorts; and the effect of this process has been a marked increase in the number of comparatively small-size firms. In Italy, this business downsizing process was sparked off both by the transfer of part of the manufacturing processes of large-size concerns to smaller associated firms and by the creation of horizontally integrated chains of smaller firms which started exchanging finished and semi-finished articles as well as services. And thanks to the networking model, chains of smaller manufacturing firms have been able to thrive on world markets.

       Marx’s idea of a “progressive decline in the variable capital in relation to the constant capital” and “a progressively rising organic composition, on the average, of the social capital as a whole” (Marx 1894, p. 518) is in full agreement with the view that the gap between the social nature of production activity and the private nature of appropriation is even widening. But the findings on the ratio of income from constant capital to income from variable capital have shown that, in the long Keynesian era, this has not been the case (see, e.g., Krugman 2007, chapt. 3).

Moreover, in due time the service sector tends to expand to the detriment of the industrial sector and to become predominant; and service firms are usually fairly small in size. 

In the light of this, it can be denied that the discrepancy between socialised production and private distribution is always on the increase. 

In other words, the criticism most frequently levelled against the current interpretation of the main contradiction of capitalism is that even where the evidence for an increasing trend of average firm size (i.e. the ratio of large-size to small-size firms) is held to be non-conclusive, there is no way of producing any historical evidence in support of the opposite conclusion.

## **6. Is the Capital-Labour Contradiction Systematically Escalating?** 

Conversely, the claim that an escalating conflict of interests between capital and labour paves the way for reversing the capitalistic capital-labour relation can hardly be called into question.  According to Laibman (2006, pp. 315-16), there is a stage, in the evolution of production processes, at which efficiency and productivity gains become strictly dependent on autonomy, creativity, critical discernment as well as modes of behaviour supported by sound criteria. From this, he argues, it follows that when this threshold is reached and people interiorise the idea that quality and productivity are inextricably interconnected, the highroad to socialism will be followed through as a matter of course. 

This idea is widely shared. By general agreement (see, for instance, Ben Ner 1987 and 1988, pp. 295-96), the living standard of workers is a major determinant of both the advantages granted to labour-managed firms and the difficulties they come up with. There is evidence that workers become less averse to risk and develop greater entrepreneurial skills according as their income levels increase.[[12]](#_ftn12) This is why we agree with Zamagni that “as human and social capital acquire a greater strategic role than physical and financial capital, the overriding importance of democratic governance modes becomes more and more evident also on a strictly economic plane” (Zamagni 2006, p. 60). Indeed, the greater a worker’s educational levels and qualifications, the less he will be prepared to work at the behest of another and the more he will tend to acquire the abilities necessary to run a firm first-hand. According to Bowles and Gintis (1996, p. 82), higher-income workers find it more convenient to work for a firm which they run directly.

Very often, workers in self-managed firms have the feeling that their incomes may be at risk and that they may prove unable to finance a decent standard of living for their families, but empirical observation has shown that corporate governance researchers have generally overestimated the role of risk-takers (Hansmann 1996, p. 45). An additional possible remark is that the difficulties associated with the management of corporate resources are usually the effect, not the cause, of the existing ownership right structure (see Pagano 1991a, 1991b, 1992a and 1992b and Marginson 1993, pp 149-53). 

Moreover, the abolition of hired labour in a labour-managed system gives rise to a more democratic system which reduces or eliminates alienation since workers cease being under coercion from employers (cfr. Jossa, 2012); and according to Hayek (1960, p. 133) coercion is a social evil which turns a useful thinking individual into a tool for the achievement of another's ends. Accordingly, anyone thinking, like Marx, that mankind will gradually gain more and more freedom (even though via the most tortuous of paths) can hardly doubt that democratic firm management is bound to become a reality at some point in time. In the words of Lukàcs (1968, p. 34), “Marx, much like German philosophers and chiefly Hegel, conceived of world history as a unitary process and the highroad towards liberation”.

In short, it is reasonable to assume that labour management is bound to make headway in history according as manual labour loses importance and workers acquire greater educational and professional qualifications (see, for example, Mandel 1973, p. 349). 

The widening contrast between capital and labour – let this be re-emphasised – is the offshoot of a contradiction between productive forces which change in time. On the one hand, the working class is acquiring ever greater entrepreneurial skills; on the other, production relations are still controlled by capitalists, because it is they that run enterprises. 

## **7. An Analysis of Social Conflict**

The reflections developed in the previous section can now be re-examined in the light of an interesting article on the evolution of Marx’s thought published by Finelli in 2007. 

In Marx, Finelli identified two different, even antithetical theoretical approaches to social conflict. The first of these, though specific to his younger years, extends to later years and was variously blended with the theories that Marx enunciated after he had become a major expert and critic of political economy. 

In the _Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1944_, alienation is the general category against which the younger Marx reads all of the topoi of modernity. From a Feuerbachian perspective, man is an organic being made for community life, but in capitalistic systems he undergoes a process of ontological perversion and alienation whenever he lives in isolation and egotistically keeps apart from his fellow-beings. In other words, as a young man and an enthusiastic supporter of the French revolution and Rousseau’s claim that man, born free, is a creative being with a marked inclination for interpersonal relations, Marx contrasted these ideals with the situation in capitalistic systems, where disrupted social relations combine with a mechanistic vision in expropriating and emptying individuals and determining an inversion between subject and predicate.

In his early years, Marx did not concern himself with the passage from ‘class in itself’ to ‘class for itself’ because the economic function of the proletariat originates from the awareness of its own alienation and tends to coincide ever more markedly with its revolutionary action. In other words, as the worker is alienated and dispossessed, he cannot look upon himself as a class, as a collective subject which in due time will gain keener awareness of the necessity of revolution. 

When Marx acquired a sound grounding in political economy, Finelli continues, his ontological outlook on society changed radically, and in his maturity he no longer thought of work as an essential category of human life. Rather, he came to think of labour power/workers as a generic category of history that takes a step back, as it were, and suffers capitalists to set themselves up as the historical subject of modernity par excellence. However, the moment workers come under the control of capital, concrete work turns into abstract work and stops being the unifying factor behind the construction of society: this role is taken over by an equally abstract kind of wealth, capital, which tends to change whatever it perceives as extraneous into something internal to itself and a tool for satisfying the need for ceaseless accumulation.

In Finelli’s view, the theoretical distance between Marx’s previous subject and his newly-theorised subject is wide indeed, because the specific function of this new subject is to strip work of its creative potential and of the fullness associated with its social nature: “the poietic, feverishly creative potential of _homo faber_, a social being, turns into its opposite” (p. 135).

Capital – he argues – can no longer be defined by reference to the subject-object reversal module, because abstract labour, unlike alienated labour, can only be brought to bear on the relation between labour power and capital, not on the subject-object relationship. 

Finelli’s conclusion is that while the main focus points of Marx’s earlier theoretical work were alienation and the resulting need to rise against something perceived as unnatural, in a later work such as _Capital_ he had come to think of revolution as determined by changes in the balance of powers between classes. 

The question now is: is this conclusion convincing and, above all, is it consistent with our reflections in the previous section? As far as I can see, it is acceptable for anyone thinking that higher educational and income levels are the prerequisite for the working class to develop firm management skills and, consequently, that revolution is the offshoot of changing power relations between classes and the determination of workers to abolish hired labour and substitute labour for capital in the management of firm. 

## **8. The Main Contradiction of Capitalism and the Essence of Dialectics** 

Coming to another core point of the issue, the idea that the post-capitalistic mode of production can be predicted by reference to the key contradiction of capitalism suggests analysing Marx’s dialectical method; and the moment I determine the real characteristics of the dialectical method that Marx took over from Hegel I will be in a position to demonstrate that the new mode of production to emerge from the ashes of capitalism is a democratic firm system.

From Cohen’s (2000) interesting analysis of the Hegelian core of Marx’s dialectical method we learn that all living beings display their innermost nature in external phenomena throughout their growth, and that the moment they have fully realised their nature and attained full maturity, they die and change into different entities. In other words, “the idea of dialectics is the idea of self-fulfillment in a self-destruction process capable of generating a fresh offshoot” (Cohen 2000, p. 46). Within the framework of such a dialectical proposition, socialism stands for the full realisation of liberalism. And inasmuch as it is true that the principles of liberalism are fully realised when all those involved in production, workers and managers, are free to make business decisions in line with the 'one head, one vote’ principle, the full realisation of the principles of liberalism will necessitate the self-destruction of capitalism and its transformation into a socialist economy. 

As clarified by Cohen, the field to which Hegel mainly applied the dialectical method just explained is world history. In Hegel’s approach, world history is the history of the _Weltgeist_, the spirit of the world, which is God as he makes Himself manifest on earth through the consciences of humans. According to Hegel, God sees Himself reflected in humans and His self-awareness is the self-awareness of humanity. As is well known, Marx reversed Hegel’s dialectics. Specifically, he held that world history is the history of human industry, which is magnified by the growth of productive forces within an economic base which ceases to exist when it has used up all its energy (_ibid._, pp 46-49). Accordingly, the claim that Marx and Engels held socialism to be a self-bred offshoot of capitalism purged of the capitalistic class can hardly be rated as an overstatement (Cohen, op. cit., p. 48). 

In other words, if a system ceases to exist the moment when it has realised its nature to the full, it follows that capitalism will draw to an end upon the attainment of full economic freedom. However, economic freedom will only be fully attained when freedom to decide ‘what is to be produced’ is extended from capitalists to workers and all those involved in production, all the members of a firm, are allowed to make business decisions in line with democratic principles. As a result, the high-water mark of capitalism coincides with its transformation into a subsequent form, and it is the self-destruction of capitalism that brings forth a new offshoot – a system of democratic firms.

## **9. Conclusion**

The key contradiction of capitalism has been shown to be the clash between labour power and capitalistic relations, between a productive force connoted by rapidly increasing entrepreneurial skills and production relations invariably shaped by the power of capitalists to make all the decisions concerning production. From this, it clearly follows that the only way to attain socialism is to reverse the current capital-labour relation and establish a system in keeping with the principles of market socialism. This is, admittedly, a fairly heterodox conclusion, but one which is both grounded in Marxist thought and, primarily, in full agreement with my main aim: suggesting a feasible social organisation mode compatible with Marx’s thought, rather than providing a correct interpretation of Marx's theoretical approach..

Although the issue of public intervention in the economy, i.e. the extent to which workers (citizens) may exercise control over the economy at the macroeconomic level, has not been specifically entered upon in this paper, there is no denying that the role of the State is as important in market socialism as it is in capitalist systems. For example, inasmuch as John Stuart Mill was right when he argued that production is governed by the rules of necessity, while distribution is largely the result of social choices, there are reasons to think that public intervention might be used as a tool to streamline income distribution.

The one model we hold to be absolutely irreconcilable with a self-managed firm system is an all-embracing centrally planned system implemented in ways that would interfere with the running of firms at the microeconomic level. To my knowledge, no economic theorist has ever provided conclusive evidence that a Soviet-type planned firm governance model would be compatible with self-management.

Concluding, there is one major point which, though not specifically discussed, is nonetheless implied in all my line of reasoning. While it is true that public intervention in a socialist market economy may be as extensive as it often is in regulated capitalist systems, a market economy is at odds with an all-encompassing planning model since this would automatically deprive individuals of their main incentives to economic action.

[[1]](#_ftnref1) In contrast, Rowthorn (1974) has rightly argued that the notion of the mode of production was unknown to neo-classical and neo-Ricardian economists.

[[2]](#_ftnref2) In the _Preface_ to _A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy_, Marx explained how he and Engels conceived the idea of theorising the materialistic conception of history and provided an outline of the conclusions he had first stated in full in the _German Ideology_ (Marx and Engels 1845-1846). Specifically, he wrote: “My inquiry led me to the conclusion that neither legal relations nor political forms could be comprehended whether by themselves or on the basis of a so-called general development of the human mind, but that on the contrary they originate in the material conditions of life, the totality of which Hegel, following the example of English and French thinkers of the eighteenth century, embraces within the term ‘civil society’” (Marx 1859, p. 262). 

[[3]](#_ftnref3) This view is shared both by Labriola (1965, pp. 87-96) and by Wright Mills (1962), according to whom Marx created an all-embracing scientific discipline whose underlying theoretical model covers the whole gamut of social phenomena. Conversely, Aron describes Marx’s theoretical approaches to production relations and social classes as “not fully consistent” (see Aron 1969, p. 48). 

[[4]](#_ftnref4) In some writings (Kautsky 1902, though not Kautsky 1982, part II, chap I), Kautsky denied the widespread assumption that reformism differs from revolution because the former rejects the use of violence that the latter accepts. In his opinion, the essence of revolution is the takeover of political power by a new class. Other authors (among them Settembrini 1973, p. VII, and Geary 1974, pp. 92-93) equate non-violence with passivity and hold violence to be a necessary prerequisite for the success of revolution. 

[[5]](#_ftnref5) A third type of enterprise, the ‘liberalist firm’, has been theorised by Voigt (1966) and others. According to these authors, this firm solves all coordination and control issues since the workers have the widest possible organisation powers set out in a contract specifically entered into for this purpose. On closer analysis, however, this kind of enterprise will barely appear realistic. 

[[6]](#_ftnref6) As is well known, Pareto (1926, pp. 73-74) emphasised both the vagueness of the word ‘socialism’ and the need to find a more accurate denomination. Socialism has been variously defined, but the simplest and most widely used definition is ‘an economic system where means of production are socially owned’. In the opinion of Dobb, for instance, to identify the main characteristic of a socialist economy with anything other than the social ownership of production means would amount to a break with the 19th century tradition which inspired numerous attempts to establish a socialist order. According to him, Marx and Engels, the founders of socialism, were doubtless the first theorists to lay emphasis on the social ownership principle, but later theorists followed in their wake (see Dobb 1969; see, also, Pareto 1926, p. 74; Lange 1936-37, part I, para.2, and 1958, p. 8; Sweezy 1963, p. 330; Landauer 1959, vol. I, p. 5; Wiles 1962, chap. I; Drenowski 1961, para. 2; Kornai 1971, pp. 337-38; Dobb 1970, chap. IV). Steedman (1995b, p. 1) describes socialism as a ‘proteinic’ notion whose analysis cannot be exhausted in a single book.

[[7]](#_ftnref7) In quotes from Marcuse reported in Vacca (1967a, p. 333 and 1967b, p. 253), the key contradiction of capitalism is described as “an oppressive relation opposing man to nature e, subject to object, which is perceived at the root of our civilisation and which generates oppressive social relations”, and industrial societies are said to be “the outgrowth of a historical design aimed to establish control of man over man”. 

[[8]](#_ftnref8) Panzieri, instead, highlights a conflict between Book I of _Capital_ and other Marxian works: whereas in _Capital_ the opposition between “despotism (planning) in factories and anarchy in society” is described as “the general form of the law of value”, he argues (see Panzieri 1964, p. 346), in other works we perceive the germs of a different approach (_ibid_, pp. 346 ff. and 362). 

[[9]](#_ftnref9) According to Lockwood (1964), Marx dealt with two categories of contradictions which respectively have to do with the social integration level resulting from the presence/absence of class conflict and the so-called system integration level, i.e. the extent to which the structural elements of the social order are, or are not, harmonised. In point of fact, the former category reflects conflicts between social classes and the latter reflects structural contradictions. 

[[10]](#_ftnref10) See, also, Godelier 1968, pp. 76-89.

[[11]](#_ftnref11) Countering Séve’s criticisms, Godelier argued that the point he wanted to refute was the idea that contradictions internal to production relations should subsume within themselves the whole gamut of the preconditions necessary for their solution; all these preconditions, he added, are both internal and external to production relations, but invariably internal to the mode of production. He also added that the capital-labour opposition (which is internal to production relations) is in itself incapable of sparking off revolution unless it combines with the pressure of the production forces/production relations opposition (which, by its very nature, is external to production relations).  

Lastly, he objected that a) his emphasis on the internal opposition between capital and labour was designed to direct attention to the role of class conflict and that b) he had never denied the relevance of the notion of production mode (see Godelier 1970).

Among those who look upon the antagonism between capitalists as a class and workers as a class as the main contradiction behind the capitalistic mode of production we may also mention Balibar, who rates it a constitutive element of capitalism and, as such, a historical necessity, though he simultaneously stresses the need that it be dismantled (see Balibar 1993, chap. III). 

[[12]](#_ftnref12) The suggestion that well-educated and skilled workers, rather than working for an external entrepreneur, will tend to pool their abilities and establish a firm of their own is also found in Ben Ner (1988, p. 297).
