# Annotated Bib
- Marx, Karl. *Das Kapital.* Progress Publishers, 1887, Moscow.
	- In *Das Kapital,* Marx outlines his ideals when it comes to the economy. He first starts by defining value and how it is related to labor. He then goes onto describe how money and capital flow through an economy. Building in this, he then describes how this flow of Capital and value extraction is the root cause of exploitation. The main theory that Marx brings up in this book is the labor theory of value, which is that the value of an object is the exchange value of a commodity is based, in its entirety, on the amount of labor that went into its creation.
	- *Das Kapital* is the foundational document for all other socialists resources. Understanding what everything else is based on is vitally important. In this podcast, I will be using this book to lay the ground work. I will use it for things like definitions and basic concepts like the labor theory of value.
- Rehman, Abdul et. al. "Profit Over Planet: Capitalism's Impact on Climate Crisis." *Tribune,* 28 May 2023, https://tribune.com.pk/story/2419022/profit-over-planet-capitalisms-impact-on-climate-crisis#:~:text=Capitalism%20prioritizes%20economic%20growth%20and,the%20destruction%20of%20natural%20habitats.
	- This article discusses how in our capitalist system, profit is put over all else, including the environment. It uses statistics and facts to make the case that the main reason that companies are seemingly unwilling to switch to renewable energy, the reason that the coal and oil industries are still as powerful as they are is because companies have to remain profitable in order to exist.
	- I will use this source as a means to explain some of the concrete examples of how capitalism is ruining the world around us. Climate is one of the most pressing issues of our time and we can trace that back directly to the incentive that companies have to seek profit above all else.
- Jossa, Bruno. "The Key Contradiction in Capitalist System." *Research Gate,* July 2013, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270640761_The_Key_Contradiction_in_Capitalist_System.
	- This is a paper that details the two main contradictions in capitalism: the contrast between the interests of capitalists and the interests of the laborer and the contrast between social production and private acquisition -- the production by many and the theft by the few. The argument of this paper is that the primary contradiction in capital is that the primary contradiction is between the competing interests of the bourgeoisies and the proletariat.
	- I will use this paper to talk about how there is an inherent divide in the interests of those who control the means of production and those who are forced into the system. The part where it discusses the two will be entirely unused as the paper as a whole will be going into showing that you cannot have liberation under capitalism.
