# Annotated Bib

- Marx, Karl. *Das Kapital.* Progress Publishers, 1887, Moscow.

    - In *Das Kapital,* Marx outlines his ideals when it comes to the economy. He first starts by defining value and how it is related to labor. He then goes onto describe how money and capital flow through an economy. Building in this, he then describes how this flow of Capital and value extraction is the root cause of exploitation. The main theory that Marx brings up in this book is the labor theory of value, which is that the value of an object is the exchange value of a commodity is based, in its entirety, on the amount of labor that went into its creation.

    - *Das Kapital* is the foundational document for all other socialists resources. Understanding what everything else is based on is vitally important. In this podcast, I will be using this book to lay the ground work. I will use it for things like definitions and basic concepts like the labor theory of value.

- Rehman, Abdul et. al. "Profit Over Planet: Capitalism's Impact on Climate Crisis." *Tribune,* 28 May 2023, https://tribune.com.pk/story/2419022/profit-over-planet-capitalisms-impact-on-climate-crisis#:~:text=Capitalism%20prioritizes%20economic%20growth%20and,the%20destruction%20of%20natural%20habitats.

    - This article discusses how in our capitalist system, profit is put over all else, including the environment. It uses statistics and facts to make the case that the main reason that companies are seemingly unwilling to switch to renewable energy, the reason that the coal and oil industries are still as powerful as they are is because companies have to remain profitable in order to exist.

    - I will use this source as a means to explain some of the concrete examples of how capitalism is ruining the world around us. Climate is one of the most pressing issues of our time and we can trace that back directly to the incentive that companies have to seek profit above all else.

- Jossa, Bruno. "The Key Contradiction in Capitalist System." *Research Gate,* July 2013, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270640761_The_Key_Contradiction_in_Capitalist_System.

    - This is a paper that details the two main contradictions in capitalism: the contrast between the interests of capitalists and the interests of the laborer and the contrast between social production and private acquisition -- the production by many and the theft by the few. The argument of this paper is that the primary contradiction in capital is that the primary contradiction is between the competing interests of the bourgeoisies and the proletariat.

    - I will use this paper to talk about how there is an inherent divide in the interests of those who control the means of production and those who are forced into the system. The part where it discusses the two will be entirely unused as the paper as a whole will be going into showing that you cannot have liberation under capitalism.

- Pollock, Lauren. "How Capitalism Is a Driving Force of Climate Change." *PIT Journal,* https://pitjournal.unc.edu/2022/12/24/how-capitalism-is-a-driving-force-of-climate-change/.

    - This source also talks about how capitalism is harming the environment. It talks about how the interests of capital lead companies to directly harm the environment and there isn't much to do about it. There have been attempts at trying to rein in companies' pollution, but, like always, they try and skirt it in any ways possible. Simple regulation will never be enough to contain the immense greed of companies.

    - I will use this to point out that even if you don't care about the capitalist exploiting you, the system of capital is destroying the world around us. There is no other way to look at it, the world around us is driving towards the edge of a cliff and the interests of capital are at the wheel.

- Simmons, Lee. "Is Capitalism Bad for Workers?" *Stanford Graduate School of Business,* Stanford, 7 June 2017, https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/capitalism-bad-workers.

    - This source details the harm that increasing profit margins can have for the worker. It talks about how as the capitalist is taking larger and larger slices of the pie, the workers are being left with the crumbs. The theories that it discussed were those of socialism. It shows, through data, that workers are objectively being harmed by the desire for ever increasing profits.

    - I will use this source to show how workers are being materially being harmed by the system of Capital. It will push my argument beyond just theory, because theory is just theory unless it can be shown that the theory is real.

- Waugh, Chris. "Is Capitalism Causing Climate Change?" *Global Social Challenges,* Manchester, 7 July 2022, https://sites.manchester.ac.uk/global-social-challenges/2022/07/07/is-capitalism-causing-climate-change/.

    - This is another source to show how capitalism is ruining our world and not just our lives. It talks about how the desire for endless profit. Unlike what large companies are saying, this isn't an issue that can be solved by using less or turning off the lights. The majority of emissions come from huge industry. The reason that these large industries haven't pushed to switched to renewables or invested in renewables is because it would tank their profits.

    - I will use this source to also point out how the only path forwards is to cast capitalism aside for the safer, more humane system. I will also use it to show that regardless of what we do as individuals, the only thing that can save our earth is to come together and demand change.

# Script

  

Welcome back to Mornings with Marx and today we are going to be talking about capitalism.

Quick disclaimer before we start, some of the formatting was assisted by Chat-GPT, but all ideas come solely from me and my research.

Before we go into the deep end, we need first to go over some definitions. First and most importantly, what even is value? There are three kinds of value for an object, use value, exchange value, and value. Use value is the usefulness that an object has to a person, so a hammer has a use value because it can hit nails, and air has a use value because we use it to breathe. The second kind of value, exchange value, is the value that an object has to humans. This is based on things like the quantity of the item available and the demand for the object. Value is the value that we perceive in the real world, or the price you actually pay for something. Another key concept is that of capital, the circuit of capital, and the difference between capital and money. Let's start with the circuit of capital and the difference between capital and money. Money uses the C-M-C, or commodity - money - commodity, cycle. That is, a commodity is exchanged for money, which is then exchanged for another commodity. For instance, a worker exchanges their labor for wages, which they then use to purchase necessities like food. Capital follows a similar path but with a distinct difference. Let's clarify what we mean by capital. Put simply, capital is money that is invested to generate more money. Taking that, we can then build a similar circuit. The circuit of capital is M-C-M prime, that is money - commodity - money, where the money out is greater than the money in. This raises a question, how is that excess value generated? Marx claimed that this came from labor. In order for more money to be extracted from the process than what goes in, the worker must do work or produce value that they were not paid for.
 
Now, let's delve into the contradictions inherent in capitalism. At its core, capitalism seeks relentless growth and expansion. To do this, it must minimize the input costs, the raw materials, and labor, and maximize the output price, the commodity that is sold. We can see this in companies like Amazon. In 2023, they cut almost 27,000 jobs across the entire company, and this year, they have posted record profits. This is the first contradiction - the ongoing push for companies to post higher profits year over year at the cost of workers. This cut to the workforce and wages leads to a fall in the buying power of people and a reduction in the consumption that is necessary to fuel the machine of profit. Due to the lack of consumption, there is a resulting overproduction, leading to economic crisis. During the 1920s, the United States experienced a surge in industrial production, leading to increased output in sectors such as agriculture, automotive, and consumer goods. Due to this, we saw a huge amount of surplus created and at the same time, the buying power of the worker fell, leading to the Great Depression. This is the second contradiction in capitalism, the overproduction and underconsumption that is brought on by increasing profits. the third contradiction we will be talking about today: competition versus monopolization. The need for companies to create higher and higher profits also drives competition. Competition on its own isn't necessarily a bad thing, but its implications are. Like all competitions, there are winners and losers, and when a company loses the game of capitalism, it is in the best interests of the other companies to be rid of them and either purchase the losing company or permanently remove them from the competition. This process will always lead to one company on top, which is a monopoly. The issue with monopolies is that they can do what ever they want with no repercussions because they control the entire market. An example of this is Google. They firmly dominate the search engine market and it isn't even close, and what are they doing with this power? Advertising. When browsing, the first half of the first page of Google is almost entirely ads and the websites being advertised are themselves often full of ads so much so that it is hard to use the website.

Moving beyond economic concerns, let's address a pressing issue: climate change. It's one of the greatest challenges humanity has ever faced. Despite its urgency, it appears that governments worldwide are failing to take decisive action. While there are pledges to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, the lack of meaningful action raises doubts about our ability to meet this goal. Lets examine why. One of the largest companies in the U.S. is Exxon Mobil, which is in the business of oil. This one company alone spent almost 6.8 million dollars in political lobbying in 2024, ensuring that policies will continue to be passed in their favor. The oil companies keep making billions of dollars in profit each year, while we are left holding the bag. This kind of action yields high profits now, but has disastrous impacts for future generations. It is clear that as long as there is an incentive for profit, these companies will continue to get their way regardless of what the people think. In major climate conferences across the world, there are often many oil and gas lobbyist there to push the needle in the favor of the companies. An example of this is how at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, over 2400 fossil fuel lobbyists were granted access to the summit. This sort of action that does not allow for the necessary decisions to be made that can lead to the kind of change needed to face a challenge of this magnitude.

This leads us to our final topic of the day: fascism. Fascism tends to show up in times when there is a political shift to the left. There are many examples of this across history and in the modern day, the ones we will be talking about today is in Chile in the 1970s and oddly enough, the U.S. now. In 1970, Chile democratically elected the socialist president, Salvador Allende. During his term as president, he nationalized key industries such as mining and agriculture and put them in the hands of the workers. Despite the fact that his actions were hugely beneficial and widely supported, the profit cuts for the capitalists made them unhappy. So what did they do? They funded a coup lead by a military dictator by the name of Augusto Pinochet. He went on to strip the rights of the working class, and as a part of this, he quelled the political opposition. Pinochet disappeared over 3,000 and imprisoned 30,000 of his political opponents. In modern day America, we can see a similar trend. Right now, we are witnessing one of the most well documented genocides in history. Palestine has been invaded by Israel, and many college students are rightly upset with this and have been calling for their universities to financially divest from Israel. The reaction from the police force, our federal government, state government, and college administrations has been to squash these protests. As a result of this, countless students have been arrested by our militarized police force. Because the school systems have so much to gain in terms of capital by staying invested in Israel, they are more willing to turn to fascistic measures in securing their monetary interests than to do the ethical thing and divest. Similar things happened at the Dakota Access Pipeline, where people protested the installation of a pipeline that would be devastating to the environment, and there was near military force used to kill the movement. These actions taken by our government in collaboration with corporations has led to a state of events that is shockingly similar to what we saw in Chile. There, we saw a leader who was funded by private interests to create a system designed for them that would kill any opposition to this. Here we see much the same, our politicians are advocating for the rights of corporations and using our police to shut down any dissenting voices.

It's increasingly apparent that we're facing significant challenges in our society. We are in a slow slide to fascism and our climate is rapidly deteriorating. All of this has direct ties to capitalism. If we want to start bringing down this system of oppression and injustice, we need to act as one. Organize, engage in local politics, support unions, and get involved in community. Only then can we begin to chip away at this destructive system.
