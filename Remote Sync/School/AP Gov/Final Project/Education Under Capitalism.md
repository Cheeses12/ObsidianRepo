- There is a general moral panic about the state of the children
- Things that inspire or come from good education
	- Critical thinking
	- Popular access to knowledge
	- The encyclopedia (crazy)
	- Freedom of speech
		- Not in the way that right-wing people use it now
- These ideas came from Enlightenment thinkers
	- Voltaire
	- Montesquieu
	- Rousseau
- Rousseau wrote an important book called *Emile or on Education*
	- About "the art of forging men"
	- He believed in freedom and authenticity
		- These ideals could be developed by developing a skepticism towards "polite society"
	- These ideas can be developed through education
		- Children must be allowed to be outside
		- Pursue what they are curious about
- During this time there were two main forms of education
	- Traditional, conservative, and religious
		- Child's development needs to be constrained by strict rules, giving too much freedom to children would have negative consequences
	- Progressive
		- Guided freedom
			- Adults could guide children where they are curious
		- Children would be free and free thinkers
		- These same ideas were touted by Confucius
			- People shouldn't be made to serve one purpose
				- He implemented tests to select the best educated across social classes and put them in positions of power
					- he did not test for how well they would be able to legislate, but rather, they were tested on important parts of the society
						- Culture, literature, sciences
				- Rich people can still game the system as always
- The thing that drives our current educational system is the protestant ethic
	- The idea that we have one sole purpose in life and education is the ticket to that
	- We see education as a commodity or service
		- If we buy the education, we will grow to be successful and wealthy
	- "Teaching is a service bought by students with a set of expectations"
	- The student isn't pursuing education for self improvement 
		- Students pursue education so the teacher will teach the curriculum and they will pass the class and get the diploma and get a good paying job
- Tie back to gen alpha
	- Seeing teachers as service providers is becoming the norm
		- Teachers aren't being held to the ideal of guiding children, but is more like the conservative education that was common during the enlightenment
		- Teachers have to please, students, parents and administrators
	- People don't tend to look at the root problems in society, rather the social ramifications of them
		- Capitalism is deteriorating education and the role of the educator, but all people see is that the younger generation is "worse" than the previous one
			- People want to return to the old way of education to cure the symptoms
			- "The response to capitalism's deterioration of the education system is conservatism"
- New people
	- Foucault
	- Freire
	- Bourdieu
	- Passeron
- Conservatism in education is the desire to uphold the current social order
	- "As long as nothing disrupts its harmony, the system can, in some ways, escape history by confining itself to the role of producing its  reproducers in a cycle of eternal return, since it is paradoxically by ignoring requirements other than that of its own reproduction, that is best contributes to the reproduction of the social order" - Bourdieu and Passeron
		- Schools under capitalism only reinforce current inequalities
			- Kids with wealth are more likely to succeed than poor kids
	- It is in the desire of those with power to keep education the way it is to avoid disrupting the system that gave them the power in the first place
- Foucault believed that we live in a society of discipline where institutions enforce that
	- School, work, military, prison
		- These institutions help to create docile people who won't question the current status quo
		- The education system shames those who are less fortunate than others
			- Alice tells a story of a day when a classmate came to class late and the teacher said something along the lines of "Tsk using perfume to cover the fact that you haven't showered in a week." Everybody laughed because they were expected to and wanted to gain the recognition of the teacher.
				- The classmate in question lived in a small apartment with a lot of siblings and didn't have time to take a shower and be on time for class
		- School is a place for symbolic violence
			- People who are different from the main group are shunned and made to feel unwelcome. This shame then creates obedience later in life.
- Freire talked about the banking system of education
	- The student is passively receiving everything that the all-powerful educator is saying
		- This view of education doesn't liberate the student or produce critical thinking, instead, it reproduces the current social order
			- The way to create the best learning environment is to set up a dialogue between the student and the educator where it is understood that the educator can learn from the student.
	- "When education is not liberating, the dream of the oppressed is to be the oppressor."
- One thing that contributes to the issue is that gentle parenting means that there is no authority or structure in the child's life
- One French philosopher stated that accepting authority and having someone who absolutely knows better than you is liberating
	- Comparison to museum guide. People follow the guide, stop when they stop, are quite when they are talking. They do this because there is an understanding that the guide will provide information that will "free" them.
	- The has limits, we have to be critical to who we give this trust to, simply following a random person through the museum won't lead to freedom.
		- Example is understanding that almost all climate scientists agree that the earth is warming due to human activity. This is like following the correct person through the art museum
- There is a lack of trust now in education
	- Students refuse to believe that they can be changed by their educators
	- We have turned the relationship between the educator and educated into a transaction
		- I show up in your class for X amount of time each week and you give me the pass to the future.
			- Also students see the teacher as a medium between them and information
		- Capitalism has promoted meritocracy where the people with merit have the authority and when you have an underpaid teacher, people don't associate that with merit
- Education is operating under a conservative structure
	- This structure produces symbolic violence towards those who are different to those who are not a part of the dominant group
	- Students are seen as threatening by the education system, something to be controlled and as a target for specific information
	- People view the underpaid teachers as someone with no merit
- Gen Alpha moral panic is just people pointing fingers at the symptoms of a broken system not digging into the root problem
	- Shifts societal issues onto the individual
	- When people view the issues as personal, the response is more conservatism
