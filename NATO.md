# Europe
## First Thought
- After WWII, Europe was not very stable
	- No stable currency
	- No infrastructure
	- Almost on economic collapse
	- Resurrection was exclusively tied to American aid
		- [[Bretton Woods Agreement]]
		- [[The Marshall Plan]]
		- The large amount of aid that the US gave to Europe forced Europe to give up lots of monetary power to the US
			- Prevented them from responding to market forces
			- Europe relied exclusively on USD
- US monetary intervention in Europe was done to stop "Soviet Expansionism"
- NATO deepens the extent that the US is involved with Europe
	- Stokes tensions with Russia
- NATO has been expanding rapidly, including countries that were formally in the [[Warsaw Pact]]
- The military power in NATO mostly comes from the US
	- This leaves European nations entirely under the protection of the US
		- Gives the US a outsized say in the politics of European nations
- Operation Gladio
	- Happened during the Cold War
	- The CIA and MI6 created a para-military organization under the name of NATO
		- This force resisted a potential "Soviet Threat"
		- They operated in many countries that were close geographically to the USSR
			- Stock piled guns and explosives
				- The weapons were used to enable right-wing militias in these countries and blame their actions of supposed socialist activities
				- This operation carried out 14,591 actions between January of 1969 and December of 1987 in Italy alone
					- First act was the Piazza Fontana Massacre
						- Killed 16 people and injured 88
					- Most notorious attack was the Bologna Railway Station Bombing in 1980
						- a bomb in the Bologna Railway station killed 85 and injured 200
- After WWII, the US was able to rig elections in France, Switzerland, Italy, and Greece to get people more favorable to the US in power
- The Brits couldn't stop a communist revolution in Greece, so they called the US
	- Greece was the first test of the Truman Doctrine
		- US policy to shape foreign politics to align with the interests of the US, specifically stopping the spread of communism
- In France, the US made it clear that the only way that the US would give them money was if they excluded any and all communists from their government despite the fact that they were the people's choice
- In Italy 1948, the CIA funded candidates to stop communists from winning
- The CIA funded and continues to fund an ongoing genocide in Palestine
	- Many European countries are also funding Israel
		- They do this through [[Horizon Europe]] to the tune of 111 billion euros
		- Germany alone has exported over $353 million dollars worth of weapons to Israel
- With the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the EU has lost any semblance of energy stability
	- 85% of all gas consumed in the EU originated outside the EU
	- Russia supplied 48% of all energy to Europe
	- At the start of the war, oil prices soared to $130 dollars per barrel, a 50% increase in cost
	- The cost of natural gas increased by 180% in the first two weeks of the war
	- Explosions in the Baltic Sea destroyed two large natural gas pipelines that carried it from Russia to Germany
