- The top emotions that kids feel in school is stressed and bored and 75% of feelings related to school are negative
- American politics and by extension, the American public has shifted further to the right
	- American politicians have become more and more devoted to the free market and the result of this is the cutting of corners for greater profits
		- Only so many corners to cut
			- This can be seen across America from infrastructure to factories to supply chains and to education
- The underfunding of education is to be expected under capitalism
	- People say that poor performance in schools is reason enough to cut funding even though the reason that there is poor performance in the first place is because budget was cut.
- New thing in education is more right-wing ideology being infused into education
	- Example of this is Prager U where they are known to spread outright lies and are funded by right-wing donors
		- They are widely popular due to the massive amount of money at their disposal to create polished, easily digestible content
			- The reason that they are still as successful as they are in spite of the large amount of criticism that is leveled at them is because they have lots of money and they don't challenge the status quo
		- Their new venture is Prager U kids, where they start targeting kids at a younger and younger age
- Florida is now allowing Prager U to be played in schools
