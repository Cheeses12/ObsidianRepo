- There is a general moral panic about the state of the children
- Things that inspire or come from good education
	- Critical thinking
	- Popular access to knowledge
	- The encyclopedia
	- Freedom of speech
		- Not in the way that right-wing people use it now
- These ideas came from Enlightenment thinkers
	- Voltaire
	- Montesquieu
	- Rousseau
- Rousseau wrote an important book called *Emile or on Education*
	- About "the art of forging men"
	- He believed in freedom and authenticity
		- These ideals could be developed by developing a skepticism towards "polite society"
	- These ideas can be developed through education
		- Children must be allowed to be outside
		- Pursue what they are curious about
- During this time there were two main forms of education
	- Traditional, conservative, and religious
		- Child's development needs to be constrained by strict rules, giving too much freedom to children would have negative consequences
	- Progressive
		- Guided freedom
			- Adults could guide children where they are curious
		- Children would be free and free thinkers
		- These same ideas were touted by Confucius
			- People shouldn't be made to serve one purpose
				- He implemented tests to select the best educated across social classes and put them in positions of power
					- he did not test for how well they would be able to legislate, but rather, they were tested on important parts of the society
						- Culture, literature, sciences
				- Rich people can still game the system as always
- The thing that drives our current educational system is the protestant ethic
	- The idea that we have one sole purpose in life and education is the ticket to that
	- We see education as a commodity or service
		- If we buy the education, we will grow to be successful and wealthy
	- "Teaching is a service bought by students with a set of expectations"
	- The student isn't pursuing education for self improvement 
		- Students pursue education so the teacher will teach the curriculum and they will pass the class and get the diploma and get a good paying job
- Tie back to gen alpha
	- Seeing teachers as service providers is becoming the norm
		- Teachers aren't being held to the ideal of guiding children, but is more like the conservative education that was common during the enlightenment
		- Teachers have to please, students, parents and administrators
	- People don't tend to look at the root problems in society, rather the social ramifications of them
		- Capitalism is deteriorating education and the role of the educator, but all people see is that the younger generation is "worse" than the previous one
			- People want to return to the old way of education to cure the symptoms
			- "The response to capitalism's deterioration of the education system is conservatism"
- New people
	- Foucault
	- Freire
	- Bourdieu
	- Passeron
- Conservatism in education is the desire to uphold the current social order
	- "As long as nothing disrupts its harmony, the system can, in some ways, escape history by confining itself to the role of producing its  reproducers in a cycle of eternal return, since it is paradoxically by ignoring requirements other than that of its own reproduction, that is best contributes to the reproduction of the social order" - Bourdieu and Passeron
		- Schools under capitalism only reinforce current inequalities
			- Kids with wealth are more likely to succeed than poor kids
	- It is in the desire of those with power to keep education the way it is to avoid disrupting the system that gave them the power in the first place
- Foucault believed that we live in a society of discipline where institutions enforce that
	- School, work, military, prison
		- These institutions help to create docile people who won't question the current status quo
		- The education system shames those who are less fortunate than others
			- Alice tells a story of a day when a classmate came to class late and the teacher said something along the lines of "Tsk using perfume to cover the fact that you haven't showered in a week." Everybody laughed because they were expected to and wanted to gain the recognition of the teacher.
				- The classmate in question lived in a small apartment with a lot of siblings and didn't have time to take a shower and be on time for class
		- School is a place for symbolic violence
			- People who are different from the main group are shunned and made to feel unwelcome. This shame then creates obedience
