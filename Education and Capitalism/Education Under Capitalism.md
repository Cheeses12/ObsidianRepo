- Things that inspire or come from good education
	- Critical thinking
	- Popular access to knowledge
	- The encyclopedia
	- Freedom of speech
		- Not in the way that right-wing people use it now

	- The student isn't pursuing education for self improvement 
		- Students pursue education so the teacher will teach the curriculum and
