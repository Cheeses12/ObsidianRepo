# Europe
## First Thought
- After WWII, Europe was not very stable
	- No stable currency
	- No infrastructure
	- Almost on economic collapse
	- Resurrection was exclusively tied to American aid
		- [[Bretton Woods Agreement]]
		- [[The Marshall Plan]]
		- The large amount of aid that the US gave to Europe forced Europe to give up lots of monetary power to the US
			- Prevented them from responding to market forces
			- Europe relied exclusively on USD
- US monetary intervention in Europe was done to stop "Soviet Expansionism"
- NATO deepens the extent that the US is involved with Europe
	- Stokes tensions with Russia
- NATO has been expanding rapidly, including countries that were formally in the [[Warsaw Pact]]
- The military power in NATO mostly comes from the US
