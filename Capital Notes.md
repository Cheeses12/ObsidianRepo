# Value
- A commodity is a physical object that is able to satisfy human need
	- Traded for things of equal value 
	- Commodities only have value because of their relationship to humans
	- Value is attributed to two things: qualitative characteristics and quantitative characteristics
		- Qualitative characteristics are the physical attributes of an object
		- Quantitative is how many of it are there
- Theory of values
	- Use value
		- Utility of a thing, how useful is it to someone
		- Based on qualitative characteristics
		- Without a person to use a glass, it has no value.
	- Exchange value
		- Value created by humans for an object
		- Influenced by quantity of the object available
			- If more people wat a limited supply of something, the value will increase
			- Ultimate comparison is to labor
	- Value
		- How we experience value in reality
- Labor time
	- Things only have value because there was human work done to create them
		- Using an ax as an example
			- With out human labor, everything would still be raw materials. The handle would still be a tree and the raw iron ore would still be in the ground
	- Measured by duration
	- Quantified by average time to complete a task
		- Labor time that is socially necessary to bring about the creation of an object
		- Unskilled workers who take longer to complete a certain task don't get paid more because it takes longer
		- Example with weavers
			- When the loom was introduced, the time that it took to create a certain amount of cloth was cut in half. Because of this, the people who didn't switch, had their wages cut in about half.
	- Two equally valuable items are those which take the same amount of labor time to create
- Things can have use value without having value
# Formula of Capital
- All capital is money but not all money is capital
	- Money is CMC while capital is MCM
		- The commodity that workers sell is their labor power
- First step is going from money to commodity
	- You take money and buy something with it
- Next step is taking the commodity and selling it again
- The motivation in the MCM circuit is to end up with more money
	- You take the item you buy and you exchange it for more than you bought it for
	- The circuit is more accurately described by MCM' where M' = M + S
		- S is know as surplus value, value that was not initially present when the capitalist bought the commodity
		- You can perform this indefinitely
# Contradictions in The Formula of Capital
- Where does surplus value even come from
- When the capitalist buys something, there person that they bought it from sees it only as selling and there person who buys the item from the capitalist only sees it as buying
- Exchanging two in equivalent items does not create surplus value
# The Sale and Purchase of Labor Power
- Surplus value comes from the sale and purchase of labor power
- The only place where surplus value can come from is the C part of MCM
- Capitalists employ people to use their labor on the commodity
	- This increases the value of the commodity
- Labor power is the sum of all mental and physical capabilities in a human
	- Exercised when a laborer produces a use value
- Every person owns their own labor power and can sell it as they see fit
- When a person is fr
