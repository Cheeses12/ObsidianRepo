# Value
- A commodity is a physical object that is able to satisfy human need
	- Traded for things of equal value 
	- Commodities only have value because of their relationship to humans
	- Value is attributed to two things: qualitative characteristics and quantitative characteristics
		- Qualitative characteristics are the physical attributes of an object
		- Quantitative is how many of it are there
- Theory of values
	- Use value
		- Utility of a thing, how useful is it to someone
		- Based on qualitative characteristics
		- Without a person to use a glass, it has no value.
	- Exchange value
		- Value created by humans for an object
		- Influenced by quantity of the object available
			- If more people wat a limited supply of something, the value will increase
			- Ultimate comparison is to labor
	- Value
		- How we experience value in reality
- Labor time
	- Things only have value because there was human work done to create them
		- Using an ax as an example
			- With out human labor, everything would still be raw materials. The handle would still be a tree and the raw iron ore would still be in the ground
	- Measured by duration
	- Quantified by average time to complete a task
		- Labor time that is socially necessary to bring about the creation of an object
		- Unskilled workers who take longer to complete a certain task don't get paid more because it takes longer
		- Example with weavers
			- When the loom was introduced, the time that it took to create a certain amount of cloth was cut in half. Because of this, the people who didn't switch, had their wages cut in about half.
	- Two equally valuable items are those which take the same amount of labor time to create
- Things can have use value without having value
