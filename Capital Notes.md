- A commodity is a physical object that is able to satisfy human need
	- Traded for things of equal value 
	- Commodities only have value because of their relationship to humans
	- Value is attributed to two things: qualitative characteristics and quantitative characteristics
		- Qualitative characteristics are the physical attributes of an object
		- Quantitative is how many of it are there
- Theory of values
	- Use value
		- Utility of a thing, how useful is it to someone
		- Based on qualitative characteristics
		- Without a person to use a glass, it has no value.
	- Exchange value
		- Value created by humans for an object
		- Influenced by quantity of the object available
			- If more people wat a limited supply of something, the value will increase
			- Ultimate comparison is to labor
	- Value
		- How we experience value in reality
- Labor time
	- Things only have value because there was human work done to create them
		- Using an ax as an example
			- With out human labor, everything would still be raw materials. The handle would still be a tree and the raw iron ore would still be in the ground
