- Mostly not about religion, mostly about land
- Competing nationalisms
- Ottoman Empire ruled over what is now Palestine
	- 87% Muslim
	- 10% Christian
	- 3% Jewish
	- Arabic was the predominant language
	- Religious populations were roughly equal in Jerusalem 
	- Ottoman Palestine was a place of religious peace
	- **Theodor Herzl** was convinced that Jewish people need their own country
- *Zionism* is the belief in Jewish nationalism
- Most Zionists believed that Israel was a state for Jews not a Jewish state
- British involvement
	- British government hoped to gain the support of Jewish people and declared Palestine as a Jewish state while Palestine was still apart of the Ottoman Empire [[Balfour Declaration]]
	- Brits also promised Palestine to the French
	- Brits also promised Palestine to the Arabs (Mecans)
	- Brits thought that they would rule until the Palestinian people could rule themselves, the Palestinians were ready to rule, the Brits didn't want to give up power
	- Set up different institutions for Christians, Jews, and Muslims
		- makes it easier for brits to "divide and rule"
	- Still tried to uphold the [[Balfour Declaration]]
		- Jewish population grew by more than 320,000 people
		- Just under 30% of the entire population of Palestine
- New Jewish population focused on purchasing land from absentee non-Palestinian Arab landowners and then evicted the Palestinians who were farming that land
	- By controlling the land and labor, they hoped to create more of a secure community
	- Palestinians hated this and revolted
	- Jewish population in collaboration with the brits crushed the revolution
- Brits tried to limit Jewish immigration to Palestine
