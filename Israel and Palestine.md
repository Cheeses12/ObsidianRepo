## CrashCourse
### John Green
- Mostly not about religion, mostly about land
- Competing nationalisms
- Ottoman Empire ruled over what is now Palestine
	- 87% Muslim
	- 10% Christian
	- 3% Jewish
	- Arabic was the predominant language
	- Religious populations were roughly equal in Jerusalem 
	- Ottoman Palestine was a place of religious peace
	- **Theodor Herzl** was convinced that Jewish people need their own country
- *Zionism* is the belief in Jewish nationalism
- Most Zionists believed that Israel was a state for Jews not a Jewish state
- British involvement
	- British government hoped to gain the support of Jewish people and declared Palestine as a Jewish state while Palestine was still apart of the Ottoman Empire [[Balfour Declaration]]
	- Brits also promised Palestine to the French
	- Brits also promised Palestine to the Arabs ([[Meccans]])
	- Brits thought that they would rule until the Palestinian people could rule themselves, the Palestinians were ready to rule, the Brits didn't want to give up power
	- Set up different institutions for Christians, Jews, and Muslims
		- makes it easier for brits to "divide and rule"
	- Still tried to uphold the [[Balfour Declaration]]
		- Jewish population grew by more than 320,000 people
		- Just under 30% of the entire population of Palestine
- New Jewish population focused on purchasing land from absentee non-Palestinian Arab landowners and then evicted the Palestinians who were farming that land
	- By controlling the land and labor, they hoped to create more of a secure community
	- Palestinians hated this and revolted
	- Jewish population in collaboration with the brits crushed the revolution
- Brits tried to limit Jewish immigration to Palestine during the Holocaust
- Arab Palestinians were upset that they had to wait another decade for a state
- Brits handed the issue of the colony over to the new United Nations
- United nations voted to split Palestine into separate Jewish and Palestinian states
	- ![[Pasted image 20240510174001.png]]
- War broke out with the Palestinians and other Arab nations on one side and the Jewish people on the other
	- Israel won and took more land from Palestine
- Nakba
	- 700,000 Palestinians fled their home and became refugees, Israel became a nation
- Israel went to war with the surrounding Arab nations and took the West bank, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights, and the Sinai Peninsula (Six Days War)
	- Israel now controlled almost all of Palestine
- The UN signed a resolution that made Israel give up the land that was taken in the 6 days war
- Broader Israeli-Arab conflict turned into Palestinian conflict
- Israel started to settle in Palestinian land again
	- West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza Strip
	- These settlements aren't legal by international law
		- Israel counters by not recognizing Palestine as a country
- Gave rise to the first Intifada
	- This then gave rise to Hamas
		- Launched first suicide bombing against Israel in 1993
		- Hamas had lots of social welfare projects in Gaza, mostly why they gained power
			- Built and staffed schools
			- Built clinics
			- Built mosques
	- First peace talks between Israel and Palestine
- The Clinton talks got closer than anyone else in the past had to getting peace in the area
- **Ariel Sharon** brought armed guards to the Temple Mount in the old city of Jerusalem
	- Muslims call it the Al-Aqsa Mosques
		- Third holiest place in Islam
	- Holiest site in Judaism
	- This led to the second Intifada
		- 3,000 Palestinians were killed, 1,000 Israelis were killed
		- In response to this, the Israelis built a wall that excluded the Palestinians from the land that was legally theirs, but had been settled by the Israelis
- Hamas, since taking power, has been launching rockets into Israel and in turn, Israel has been invading Palestine
- Internal logic of the countries
	- Palestinians have been denied statehood since like the dawn of time, first by the brits, and now by their occupiers
	- Israel is a home for one of the most historically oppressed groups. It views itself as trying to protect itself from the very real threats around it
